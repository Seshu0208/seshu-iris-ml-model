## 📌 Project Overview

The project includes the following key components:

- 📊 **Model Training & Evaluation**
  - Train and evaluate a classification model using the Iris dataset.

- 🧪 **Unit Testing**
  - Validate model logic and evaluation metrics using **pytest**.

- 📦 **Dependency Management**
  - Manage project dependencies through a `requirements.txt` file.

- 🤖 **CI/CD Automation**
  - Automate testing and validation using **GitHub Actions**.

- ⚡ **Parallel & Multi-Stage Pipelines**
  - Execute tests across **multiple Python versions** in parallel.
  - Enforce sequential stages for security validation.

- 🔐 **Security Gates**
  - Integrate security scans to block merges on detected issues.
